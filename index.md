### Exams

### Policies

The assigned problems are due each Friday in-class, listed on this page. Homeworks contribute to your final grade. Students must make arrangements in advance if they will not be handing in homework on time.

We encourage you to discuss homework problems with your classmates, including strategies for solving different kinds of problems. However, when you actually write up your solutions, you must do this on your own.
