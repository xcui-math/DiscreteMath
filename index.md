### Objectives

### Prerequisites

### Textbooks

The official textbook is 

```[离散数学](https://www.amazon.cn/dp/B00114CIWC)，左孝凌、李为鑑、刘永才，上海科学技术文献出版社，1982年9月.```

However, I will also follow parts of

``` [Discrete Mathematics with Proof (2nd Edition)](https://www.amazon.cn/dp/0470457937/), Eric Gossett, John Wiley & Sons, Jun 22, 2009.```

This book is very well-written, but is quite expensive to buy in China. It is absolutely possible to excel at this course without buying it.

Further references will be given in due course.



### Exams

### Policies

The assigned problems are due each Friday in-class, listed on this page. Homeworks contribute to your final grade. Students must make arrangements in advance if they will not be handing in homework on time.

We encourage you to discuss homework problems with your classmates, including strategies for solving different kinds of problems. However, when you actually write up your solutions, you must do this on your own.
