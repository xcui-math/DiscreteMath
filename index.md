Office Hour: Friday 13:00 - 14:30pm in my office, and before/after lectures in the classroom.

### Objectives

This course covers several topics such as logic, altorithm, counting, finite probably, models of computation and graph theory. The aim is two-folded. First, it serves as an introductory for the subsequent courses on each individual subjects. Second, we high light the use of mathematical structures and thinking in the process, so it provides us a systematic way to see how mathematical theories are developed in each cases. The lecture carries a little bit more the "top-down" flavor, meaning we shall start by introducing objects and axioms, and then all the properties and important results are derived from the axioms. On the other hand, our textbook provides a nice illustration of the "bottom-up" approach, which starts with discussion on explicitly properties and results first without giving axioms. It is desirable to study the subject using both points of view.

### Prerequisites

High school Mathematics; first year calculus and algebra courses would be helpful, but not necessary.

### Textbooks

The official textbook is 

[离散数学](https://www.amazon.cn/dp/B00114CIWC)，左孝凌、李为鑑、刘永才，上海科学技术文献出版社，1982年9月.

However, I will also follow parts of

[Discrete Mathematics with Proof (2nd Edition)](https://www.amazon.cn/dp/0470457937/), Eric Gossett, John Wiley & Sons, Jun 22, 2009.

This book is very well-written, but is quite expensive to buy in China. It is absolutely possible to excel at this course without buying it. Even if you do not own a copy of it, it is still benefitial to have a look at the [supporting materials](http://www.mathcs.bethel.edu/~gossett/DiscreteMathWithProof/) provided generously by the author.

[Further references and lecture notes](/lecture.md) will be provided in due course.

### Exams & Scores

There will be one midterm and one final exams. The exams are closed-book, but you are allowed to prepare your own cheatsheet on one A4 paper.

The total score of this course consists of the following:
+ 10% Attendance
+ 25% Homework
+ 25% Midterm
+ 40% Final

### Policies

#### Homework

Homeworks will be assigned almost every two weeks, and will be posted on this webpage. The assigned problems are due every other Friday in-class. Students must make arrangements in advance if they will not be handing in homework on time. Please don't wait until the last hour to do the homework.

Each assignment will be graded out of 10 points: 5 points for making a good effort at completing each part of the homework, 2 points for technically-correctness in your solutions, and 3 points for clear descriptions, interpretations and explanations with easily recognizable handwritting.

You are encouraged to discuss about homeowork problems with others, but each one of you must write your own answers (using your own words). Copy and plagiarism will not be tolerated (see Academic Honesty policy).

#### Learning Cooperatively

With the exception of exams, we encourage you to discuss all of the course activities with your classmates as you are working on them. You will definitely learn more in this class if you work with others. Please ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally.

#### Academic Honesty

Collaborating on homework is fine but copying is NOT. At the same time, you should not share your homework answers directly with others. Please feel free to discuss the problems with others, but not the solutions. If you suspect other people may be plagiarizing you, let me know as soon as possible. 

Cheating in any form will be strictly prohibited. Anyone found cheating will get an 0 for the corresponding score, and will be reported to the students conduct center. If you are having trouble with assignments or studying for an exam, or if you are uncertain about permissible and impermissible conduct or collaboration, please come to me with your questions.

#### Email Policy

I encourage you to ask questions about the syllabus, covered material, and homeworks during lectures. However, if office hours conflict with your schedule, please use email to set up a one-on-one meeting with me. Use the subject line "DiscreteMath Meeting Request" for your message, and please include a brief description of the reason for the meeting.
