Recommended reading: 
+ David Austin, [The stable merriage problem and school choice](http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fc-2015-03). The article is in English and pretty long, but please do not be terrified. I hope that you can enjoy the process of trying to read (even small parts) of it!
+ 如果你喜欢玩旅行青蛙（旅かえる），不妨读一下这篇[技术分析](https://www.zhihu.com/question/68733553/answer/305463907)。以后我们会学到图论和相关算法。
