## Lecture Information & Schedule

### Lecture 1: Introduction

#### March 5, 2018

This is an introductory lecture aiming on explaning what is Discrete Mathematics, what kind of problems we will encounter and what is the strategy to solve them. Example problems： stable marriage problem and the deferred acceptance algorithm, which is related to the 2012 Nobel Prize in Economics, the [Sierpiński curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_curve), the [seven bridges of Königsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg), and [Kirkman's schoolgirl problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkman%27s_schoolgirl_problem). Course syllabus and how to excel in it.

Further recommended reading: 
+ David Austin, [The stable marriage problem and school choice](http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fc-2015-03). The article is in English and pretty long, but please do not be terrified. I hope that you can enjoy the process of trying to read (even small parts) of it!
+ 如果你喜欢玩旅行青蛙（旅かえる），不妨读一下这篇[技术分析](https://www.zhihu.com/question/68733553/answer/305463907)。以后我们会学到图论和相关算法。

### Lecture 2, 3, 4: Sets, Logic and Boolean Algebras

Lecture notes can be found [here](/Lecture_Notes.pdf): last updated: Mar 16, 2018. 

#### March 9, 2018

An introductory lecture about set theory and propositional logic (unfinished). We started from the relevant definition about sets, various m-nary operations and results about commutativity, associativity and distributivity. The motivation of propositional logic, various m-nary operations on it, and the truth table.

Recommended exercise:
+ Finish the exercises given during the lecture.
+ 阅读教材的相关内容————对同样的内容通过不同的方式（听课，阅读不同版本的文献，查询[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/)等等）进行学习可以加深理解，巩固基础。

#### March 12, 2018

Implication and bicondition; statements viewed as "constant" operations and the tree graph to denote compound operations. Boolean algebras, revisiting the example from set theory and propositional logic, and its theoretical importance. Then we moved to the introduction of predicate logic.

#### March 16, 2018

Predicate logic: the quantifiers, their domain and computation rules; Exercises; further applications: Island with inhabitants, logic circuit, and [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku).
